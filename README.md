Deep Scattering network

The thesis aims to develop a methodology based on deep Scattering  networks to radically improve the quality of denoising and classification of seismic data provided by the DAS. In this study, an approach has been developed to reliably detect and categorise CO2 gas bubble signals by exploiting the ability of scattering networks to extract essential signal features in low-noise space. In addition, the paper describes the use of dimensionality reduction and unsupervised clustering techniques to identify specific patterns characteristic of magma bubble activity.
